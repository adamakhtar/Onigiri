##Known parsing problems##
#1/4 to 1/3 cup (60 to 80 ml) maple syrup (less for less sweetness, of course)
#1/4 cup olive oil => why is it extracting only oil and not olive oil 
#1.0 - large -  - clove <==> 1 large clove garlic, thinly sliced => confusing clove spice with measurment clove
#1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or more or less to taste => keeps matching red pepper and not flakes
#Juice of one lemon => get juice of extracted as modifier
#5 to 6 cups low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth => should extract "chicken or vegetable borth" and not "chicken"
